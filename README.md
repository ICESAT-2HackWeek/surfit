# Surfit üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is as an example on how teams can structure their project repositories. Thanks to Lindsey Heagey and Joachim Meyer for the template, provided originally for [Geohackweek](https://github.com/geohackweek/sample_project_repository).

## Files

* `.gitignore`
<br> Globally ignored files by `git` for the project.
* `environment.yml`
<br> `conda` environment description needed to run this project.
* `README.md`
<br> Description of the project. [Sample](https://geohackweek.github.io/wiki/github_project_management.html#project-guidelines)

## Folders

### `contributors`
Each team member has it's own folder under contributors, where he/she can
work on their contribution. Having a dedicated folder for one-self helps to 
prevent conflicts when merging with master.

The following people contributed to our project throughout the week:
* Project lead: [Ben Purinton](url to their webpage)
* Project lead: [David Clemens-Sewall](url to their webpage)
